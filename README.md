# Medical Insights Dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed for a comprehensive analysis of patient admissions and hospital data. The project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow, from data cleaning and transformation to creating an interactive and insightful dashboard.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to leverage a medical dataset to provide key insights for hospital administrators and healthcare professionals. The dashboard addresses critical questions about patient demographics, admission trends, and billing information to help optimize hospital operations.

## Key Features & Visualizations
The interactive dashboard is organized into several sections, each providing a clear and concise overview of the data.

-Total Admissions & Stays: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) showing total patient admissions, average length of stay, and total billing amount.
-Admissions by Gender: A donut chart illustrating the near-even split of admissions between male and female patients.
-Stays by Medical Condition: A bar chart that compares the average length of stay for various medical conditions, highlighting which conditions require longer hospitalization.
-Admissions Over Time: A line chart that visualizes monthly admission trends, revealing seasonal patterns in patient visits.
-Billing by Provider: A treemap chart that shows the total billing amount, broken down by major insurance providers.


## Skills & Tools
-Power BI: Used for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
-Data Analysis: Applied to interpret the dataset, identify key trends, and provide actionable insights.
